# Atif Aiman

Hello guys, and assalamualaikum! I am Atif Aiman, also known as alserembani. Welcome to my Github, where I put all my inspiration and ideas!

## ü•º My expertise

- **React:** I have been in React since 2018, well versed in developing components, along with pixel-perfect styling üòÅ
- **Typescript:** Initially I was so afraid learning Typescript, but now there's no way back for me üòÜ
- **NodeJS:** Well versed in NodeJS as well, training myself for more challenges like Codewars.
- **UI/UX Optimisation:** Since I was a designer before, I am very particular in UI/UX, and love to deliver perfectly, from pixel to pixel! ‚ú®
- **NextJS:** For the love of modern tech, SSR and SSG is my current jam, rocking it very well!
- **AWS:** Though not everything, but after all burnout for need to learn them for a really short time, I know how to handle them.

## ü§© My interest

- **Frontend Development:** I am so excited when people give me the design, and I will develop it as perfect as I can. And not forget, the UX is on top of my priority as well!
- **New tech stack:** I would love to hear about new tech stack. But of course, I will take it one by one, so I can be articulate on those!
- **Ambassador:** I love to tell people how awesome coding is! Whatever your background is, as long as you believe you can fly, I will make you fly!

## üî¨ My current exploration

Right now, here are the things that I currently learning, either because working requirement, or I just curious

- **Vue:** Yet another JS frontend framework, but mostly because of my working needs.
- **Docker:** Still exploring, but need time to really explore the possibilities.
- **Tailwind:** I am more towards native, but that doesn't mean I can't go for CSS frameworks, can I?
